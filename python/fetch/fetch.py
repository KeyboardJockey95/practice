# skeleton starter for Fetch
#
# Fetch:
#   Learn how to read a web page (request an HTTPS URL and get back HTML)
#
#   For our initial implementation, we will fetch the first-ever web page, "The World Wide Web project"
#   http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html
#   and print out some statistics
#

print("Hello, world, from Fetch!")
